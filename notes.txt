Maybe a demo for NOVA 2018 :)

TO DO
~~~
Move music out of Core RAM - put in SWRAM for now (leave ANDY & HAZEL?) - DONE
Move Kefrens module to SWRAM - leave expanded codegen to begin with
Port another FX module into framework - Twister?
System for switching between FX - leave music broken for now!
Decompress screen data from SWRAM
Decompress generated code from SWRAM?

For switching between FX it's probably OK to reenable interupts & run the vgm_player on an event
Just need to re-vsync after initialising the next part
